                 transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br>
                  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly <br>
                   The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,<br>
                 I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

             <h4>Such a life-changing 
                 experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
            <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve 
                 never written a line of code. I needed 
                  some structure from professionals 
                   who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
                    a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
                    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                     It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, 
                     I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                 developer after receiving multiple 
                 offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

        <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. <br>
             The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>
             myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br>
